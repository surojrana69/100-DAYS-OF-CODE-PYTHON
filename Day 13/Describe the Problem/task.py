# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#Ans. Since variable i is in range between 1 and 20(which exclude upperbound 20) which will not satisfy the i=20 condition.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#ans. Only if variable is between 1 and 19.
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#ans. Null
